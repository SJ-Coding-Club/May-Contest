#### Problem 0: ```num-sum```
Write a program that computes the sum of all consecutive integers from ```1``` to ```100``` without simply doing ```1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100```. There are multiple ways to do this, but one way is most efficient.

#### Problem 1: ```counting-leaps```
A leap year occurs on any year that is divisible by ```4```, except for century years (like ```1900```), which must be divisible by ```400``` to be considered leap years. Write a program that calculates the number of leap years that occurred between ```1430``` and ```2021```.

#### Problem 2: ```n-factorial```
The ```factorial``` of ```n```, denoted as ```n!```, is the product of ```n``` and every positive integer below it.
```python
# For example:
1! = 1
2! = 2 * 1 = 2
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```
Write a program that takes any integer ```n``` as input and calculates ```n!```

#### Problem 3: ```high-low-average```
Write a program that takes an unsorted list of 5 numbers as input and returns the average of the highest number and the lowest number.
```python
# Example
>>> high_low_average([5,4,2,8,3])
5.0
```
#### Problem 4: ```most-common-char```
Write a program that takes a string of characters as input and returns the single most common letter in the statement.
```python
# Examples
>>> most_common_char('hello')
'l'
>>> most_common_char('Lemonade')
'e'
```
